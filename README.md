# Enron - The Revival

I was contracted to build a satirical website announcing the revival of Enron. The site was built using Angular, so you can clone it and run it yourself if you'd like. There are some custom animations that I'm pretty proud of (I'm very anti-library so all animations were custom Javascript or CSS keyframes). If you don't want to go through the headache of making sure your Node version is compatible with mine, you're in luck. I've attached some screenshots of the site below for your viewing pleasure.
